# Examples
This repository contains example code that uses [nspyre](https://github.com/nspyre-org/nspyre).

The "demo" folder contains example code with fake instrument drivers so that 
it can be run on any system without real hardware. The demo code is intended to 
help new users understand how nspyre works and its capabilities.

The "experiments" folder is intended for both new and old users of nspyre to 
share the code that runs their actual experiment. Hopefully by sharing our 
code, we can all learn new and interesting ways of structuring our experiments.

If you want to contribute any experiment or demo code, please submit a 
[pull request](http://TODO).
