# Examples
This repository contains example code that uses [nspyre](https://github.com/nspyre-org/nspyre).

The "experiments" folder is intended for users of nspyre to 
share the code that runs their actual experiment. Hopefully by sharing our 
code, we can all learn new and interesting ways of structuring our experiments.

Unless otherwise specified, code is provided under the terms of the MIT license.
