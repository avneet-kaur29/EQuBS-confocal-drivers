# Examples
This repository contains example code that uses [nspyre](https://github.com/nspyre-org/nspyre).

The "demo" folder contains example code with fake instrument drivers so that 
it can be run on any system without real hardware. The demo code is intended to 
help new users understand how nspyre works and its capabilities.

The "experiments" folder is intended for both new and old users of nspyre to 
share the code that runs their actual experiment. Hopefully by sharing our 
code, we can all learn new and interesting ways of structuring our experiments.

Unless otherwise specified, code is provided under the terms of the MIT license.

## Contributing

If you want to contribute code, please submit it as a 
[pull request](https://nspyre.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing.html#forking-pull-requests). You should include a README file with your code to 
explain what it does.
